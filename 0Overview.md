# Overview
  **Definition of Machine Learning:**  
An algorithm that is able to learn from data.

  **What is the meaning of *learning*?**  
A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* w.r.t. some class of tasks *T* and performance *P*, if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*.
  * *T* -- [the task](https://github.com/PionC/Machine-Learning-Notes/blob/main/1ML_Algorithms.md).
  * *P* -- [the performance measure](https://github.com/PionC/Machine-Learning-Notes/blob/main/1ML_Algorithms.md).
  * *R* -- [the experience](https://github.com/PionC/Machine-Learning-Notes/blob/main/1ML_Algorithms.md).

### **Types of Machine Learning**
* **Supervised Learning:**
Learns from being given "right answers" (with lables). 
  * Regression: Predict a number infinitely with many possible outputs.
  * Classification: Predict categories with small number of possible outputs.


* **Unsupervied Learning:**
Find something in unlabeled data (without lables). Algorithm has to find structure in the data.
    * Clustering: Group similar data points together.
    * Anomaly Detection: Find unusual data points.
    * Dimiensionality Reduction: Compress data using fewer numbers.

* **Reinforrcement Learning:**
### **Terminology**
* (x, y) means single training example, and $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ means the $i^{th}$ training example.
